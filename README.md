## Introduction

The following code contains the Caesar encryption, a form of substitution cipher that involves shifting each letter of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. For example, if the shift is 3, then "A" would be encrypted as "D," "B" as "E," and so on..

## Dependencies

To run this implementation, you need:

- Python 3.x
- The `string` module (usually included in Python standard library)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/elcruzo/caesar-encryption.git
   cd caesar-encryption
   ```

2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can check by running:

   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

   If Python is not installed, you can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory containing the `index.py` file.

2. Open the `index.py` file in your preferred text editor or IDE.

3. Run the `index.py` script using the following command:

   ```bash
   python3 index.py
   ```

6. Upon execution, the script will give the encrypted version of the <b>plain text</b> (on line 14 of the script).

## Example

Here's a brief example of how to run the code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elcruzo/caesar-encryption.git
cd caesar-encryption
python3 index.py
```
